# Composize

Composize is a library for composing functions in JavaScript. It gives a possibility to compose classical functional programming methods, fantasy-land containers, iterators and parsers.

## Motivation

In the world of functional programming, composition is a powerful concept that allows developers to build complex operations from simpler ones. However, in JavaScript, composing different types of functions and data structures can often be cumbersome and inconsistent.
Composize aims to solve this problem by providing a unified and intuitive way to compose various elements:

Functional Programming Methods: Easily chain and combine pure functions for cleaner, more maintainable code.

```js
const sentences = ['Hello world', 'Functional programming is fun', 'Composize makes it easy'];

const processStrings = pipe(
  map(s => s.toLowerCase()),
  map(s => s.split(' ')),
  map(words => words.reverse()),
  map(words => words.join(' ')),
  reverse,
  head
);

console.log(processStrings(sentences)); // Output: 'easy it makes composize'
```

Fantasy-land Containers: Seamlessly work with monads, functors, and other algebraic structures without breaking the flow of your composition.


Iterators: Compose operations on iterables and generators, enabling efficient processing of large or infinite data streams.


Parsers: Build complex parsers from simpler ones, making it easier to handle complex data formats and domain-specific languages.



Whether you're working on data transformation pipelines, building domain-specific languages, or just looking to leverage functional programming concepts in your JavaScript projects, Composize provides the tools to make function composition both powerful and accessible.
