# Functional Programming Methods in Composize

## Introduction

Composize provides a comprehensive set of functional programming methods that allow you to write clean, modular, and reusable code. These methods are designed to work with arrays, objects, and other data structures, enabling you to perform complex operations with ease.

The functional programming paradigm emphasizes the use of pure functions, immutability, and declarative code. Composize's methods adhere to these principles, helping you write more predictable and easier-to-test code.
